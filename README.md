Predicting insurance charges
===============
###### _All data here presented can be obtained on the website:_ (https://github.com/stedy/Machine-Learning-with-R-datasets)

This is a personal project which in I do an Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on the insurance.csv dataset as well as try to predict the insurance charges depending on several features from the user.

For this project I used Python and the following libraries:
- Pandas
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn
- Numpy
- Scikit-learn

To predict the insurance charges, it was used five models from the scikit-learn package:

- LinearRegressor
- Ridge
- Lasso
- DecisionTreeRegressor
- RandomForestRegressor

Besides that, RandomizedSearchCV, StandardScaler, and train_test_split were applied in the data so that the models could perform better.
